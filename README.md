Member A: Amos Kabashi 2420961
Desighn and principles lead 
REFLECTION: Software design in 2025: Explaining design as process and artifacts, Trends(micrservice and AI-integration), application-first and principle-first. Relating and choosing the best that could fit our project (USEP)


Member B: Bristol Shalowa 2421003
Business analyst
REFLECTION:I focused on defining the problem and analyzing why investing in USEP would be worthwhile. This required me to carefully review the fragmented nature of student services and connect it to the challenges faced by both local and international students. Through this process, I learned how important it is to frame a problem clearly so that proposed solutions are practical and impactful.
One challenge I faced was balancing between describing the existing inefficiencies and justifying the value of a new system. To address this, I drew on both previous research and real-world examples of integrated student platforms.



Member C: Tafadzwa Mungandaire 2420974
Culture and Ops Lead
REFLECTIONS:As Member C, my contribution centered on translating design thinking insights into robust software artifacts while embedding sustainability, accessibility, and inclusivity into the Unified Student Experience Platform (USEP).

Key Responsibilities

1. System Modeling

Designed and refined UML diagrams (class and sequence diagrams) to ensure requirements traceability.

Applied object-oriented principles and reusable design patterns, ensuring maintainability within the team’s DevOps workflow.pplied object-oriented principles and reusable design patterns, ensuring maintainability within the team’s DevOps workflow.



2. Accessibility & Inclusivity

Enforced WCAG 2.1 standards (contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility) to ensure no student is excluded due to disability.

Embedded i18n (internationalization) and l10n (localization) strategies so that the platform can support multiple languages, cultural formats, and region-specific content (Tanzania, Congo, Liberia, Zimbabwe, Somalia).

Leveraged cultural intelligence to guide design decisions, preventing bias and ensuring equitable user experience across diverse student populations.



3. DevOps and DevSecOps Alignment

Contributed to defining a CI/CD pipeline, aligning automated testing with accessibility validation.

Promoted DevSecOps practices, integrating security as code, safeguarding data privacy, and maintaining compliance.




Cross-Team Integration

Aligned Member A & B’s requirement specifications with the architectural blueprint.

Verified Member D’s implementation choices against the class diagram and accessibility standards, ensuring design consistency and long-term scalability.


Reflection

My role bridged the gap between conceptual design and real-world deployment, ensuring USEP is not only scalable and future-proof but also accessible, ethical, and globally inclusive.

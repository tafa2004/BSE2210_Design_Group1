REFLECTION:I focused on defining the problem and analyzing why investing in USEP would be worthwhile. This required me to carefully review the fragmented nature of student services and connect it to the challenges faced by both local and international students. Through this process, I learned how important it is to frame a problem clearly so that proposed solutions are practical and impactful.
One challenge I faced was balancing between describing the existing inefficiencies and justifying the value of a new system. To address this, I drew on both previous research and real-world examples of integrated student platforms.
